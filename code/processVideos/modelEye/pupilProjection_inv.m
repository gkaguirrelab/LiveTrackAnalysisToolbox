% Project an ellipse on the image plane to a pupil circle in the scene
%
% Syntax:
%  [eyePose, bestMatchEllipseOnImagePlane, centerError, shapeError, areaError] = pupilProjection_inv(pupilEllipseOnImagePlane, sceneGeometry, rayTraceFuncs)
%
% Description:
%	Given the sceneGeometry and an ellipse on the image plane, this routine
%   finds parameters of the rotation of the eye and pupil sizes that can
%   best account for the parameters of the ellipse.
%
% Notes:
%   Rotations - Eye rotations are given as azimuth and elevations in
%   degrees. These values correspond to degrees of rotation of the eye
%   relative to a head-fixed (extrinsic) coordinate frame. Note that this
%   is different from an eye-fixed (intrinsic) coordinate frame (such as
%   the Fick coordinate sysem). Azimuth, Elevation of [0,0] corresponds
%   to the position of the eye when a line that connects the center of
%   rotation of the eye with the center of the pupil is normal to the image
%   plane. Positive rotations correspond to rightward, upward, translation
%   of the pupil center in the image.
%
%   The default values set for the bounds on these rotation values reflect
%   the physical limits of the projection model. Tighter, biologically
%   informed constraints may be passed by the calling function. Note that
%   the search is underconstrained if there is freedom in the values to be
%   found for azimuth, elevation, and torsion. Indeed, Listing's Law
%   describes the tendency of the eye (for head-fixed saccades) to hold
%   torsion to zero when rotation the eye to a new location. Therefore, the
%   upper and lower bounds on torsion should generally be set to zero,
%   unless there is some specific desire to model this component under
%   different circumstances (e.g., peripheral nystagmus).
%
%   Units - Eye rotations are in units of degrees. However, the units of
%   theta in the transparent ellipse parameters are radians. This is in
%   part to help us keep the two units separate conceptually.
%
% Inputs:
%   pupilEllipseOnImagePlane - A 1x5 vector that contains the parameters of
%                           pupil ellipse on the image plane cast in
%                           transparent form
%   sceneGeometry         - The sceneGeometry structure. Defined in
%                           createSceneGeometry()
%   rayTraceFuncs         - A structure of function handles. Defined in
%                           assembleRayTraceFuncs().
%
% Optional key/value pairs:
%  'x0'                   - Starting point of the search for the eyePose.
%                           If not defined, the starting point will be
%                           estimated from the coordinates of the ellipse
%                           center.
%  'eyePoseLB/UB'         - A 1x4 vector that provides the lower (upper)
%                           bounds on the eyePose [azimuth, elevation,
%                           torsion, pupil radius]. The default values here
%                           represent the physical limits of the projection
%                           model for azimuth, elevation, and pupil radius.
%                           Torsion is constrained to zero by default as
%                           the ellipse provides no torsion information.
%  'centerErrorThreshold' - Scalar. Defines one of the two stopping point
%                           criteria for the search.
%  'constraintTolerance'  - Defines one of the two stopping point
%                           criteria for the search. If passed, this value
%                           will over-ride the value in the sceneGeometry
%                           structure.
%
% Outputs:
%   eyePose               - A 1x4 vector provides values for [eyeAzimuth,
%                           eyeElevation, eyeTorsion, pupilRadius].
%                           Azimuth, elevation, and torsion are in units of
%                           head-centered (extrinsic) degrees, and pupil
%                           radius is in mm.
%   bestMatchEllipseOnImagePlane - A 1x5 vector that contains the
%                           parameters of pupil ellipse on the image plane
%                           cast in transparent form. This is the output of
%                           the pupilProjection_fwd model for the
%                           sceneGeometry and the eyePose
%   centerError           - Scalar. The Euclidean distance (in pixels)
%                           between the [x, y] center of the
%                           pupilEllipseOnImagePlane and the center of the
%                           bestMatchEllipseOnImagePlane.
%   shapeError            - Scalar. The proportion of error in fitting
%                           ellipse shape, range 0-1.
%   areaError             - Scalar. The proportion of error in fitting
%                           ellipse area; unbounded around zero.
%   exitFlag              - The exitFlag from the fmincon search. Because
%                           we are using custom stopping criteria, a value
%                           of -1 indicates success. A value of 2 is
%                           usually returned if the solution is suspected
%                           to be a local minimum. The calling function
%                           can re-call the inverse search, supplying the
%                           initial solution as x0. This tends to allow
%                           the search to converge.
